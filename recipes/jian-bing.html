                <li>
                    <strong>Step1:</strong><br>
                    Whisk millet flour, soy milk, and vegetable oil together in a bowl 
                    to make a batter with the consistency of heavy cream. Add a teaspoon 
                    of water to thin the batter, if necessary.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step2:</strong><br>
                    Mash black bean sauce in a small bowl with 1 teaspoon water to make 
                    it easy to spread. Mix hot chili sauce with 1 teaspoon of water in a 
                    separate small bowl. Set both sauces aside.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step3</strong><br>
                    Spray a large skillet generously with cooking spray, and heat over medium-low 
                    heat. Pour batter into the skillet, and spread evenly to make a thin crepe; 
                    cook until firm, about 1 to 2 minutes. Pour egg evenly over crepe; cook an 
                    additional 1 to 2 minutes, until egg is set. Sprinkle crepe with green onion 
                    slices and cilantro leaves, pressing them firmly into cooked egg.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Step4</strong><br>
                    Flip crepe and spread with bean sauce and chili sauce. Place crackers in the 
                    center of crepe, leaving about 1/4 inch of space between the two crackers. 
                    Flip top third of crepe down over crackers; flip the bottom third up, and 
                    then fold the crepe in half so the crackers are stacked on top of each other in a 
                    tidy package. Serve hot.
